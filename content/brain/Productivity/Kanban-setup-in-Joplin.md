One of the things I’m doing is to use a sub-notebook entitled Kanban, with its own sub-notebooks set as numbered columns. I then move todo notes as if they were Kanban cards from one column to another. Enabling the notes counter gives me a WIP approach. It’s really all I need for issue tracking in many projects.
