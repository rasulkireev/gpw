**Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague.** I made this mistake myself. When I wanted to start a push-up habit, my habit stack was “When I take a break for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.” At first glance, this sounded reasonable. But soon, I realized the trigger was unclear. Would I do my push-ups before I ate lunch? After I ate lunch? Where would I do them? After a few inconsistent days, I changed my habit stack to: “When I close my laptop for lunch, I will do ten push-ups next to my desk.” Ambiguity gone.

As Voltaire once wrote, ==**"The best is the enemy of the good."**==

The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior. 
**Openness to experience**: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other. 
**Conscientiousness**: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous. 
**Extroversion**: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts). 
**Agreeableness**: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached. 
**Neuroticism**: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.
