> The best ideas are fragile; most people don’t even start talking about them at all because they sound silly. Perhaps most of all, you want to be around people who don’t make you feel stupid for mentioning a bad idea, and who certainly never feel stupid for doing so themselves.

> Another way to do this is to think about the most important tectonic shifts happening right now. How is the world changing in fundamental ways? Can you identify a leading edge of change and an opportunity that it unlocks? The mobile phone explosion from 2008-2012 is the most recent significant example of this—we are overdue for another!

> Finally, a good test for an idea is if you can articulate why most people think it’s a bad idea, but you understand what makes it good.

A lot of arguments in this post seem great and make sense. However one thing I am missing are basic examples. It just would be so much more if Sam mentioned an idea where most people think it's bad but he knows it's good.
