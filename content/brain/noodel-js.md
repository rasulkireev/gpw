> Noodel, short for node model, is a user interface for dynamic content trees that you can navigate by just moving up, down, left and right. It offers a new way to present content on the modern web that is intuitive, responsive and accessible.
Currently available as Noodel.js, a JavaScript library. Powered by the reactive view engine of Vue.js. 

Basically, nice controls for a website.
