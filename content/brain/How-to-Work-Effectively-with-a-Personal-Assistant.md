### 3 Strategies

2. Use Loom
	Quicker than writing instructions
3. Pay - $18-$20

### How to Great a Great Aissitant (is that a typo?... Seems like a lack of preparation)
* The general impression of this guide is not good... To put it mildly. Will try to keep good notes nevertheless.
* I inveted "Surgeon in the room"... Really?

* Unpack big tasks into a bunch of smaller tasks.
	That makes it possible to delegate the tasks.
* Pay your assistant $17/hr
* "Ooh, that's quick, I'll do it"... Tasks add up quickly, be careful!
	* Keep a journal to keep track of time wasted.
	* See what you did, what you liked, what can be automated what can be easily delegated.
