[Post about actually using it](https://ruivieira.dev/serving-models-with-seldon.html)

An open source platform to deploy your machine learning models on Kubernetes at massive scale.

## Overview
Seldon core converts your ML models (Tensorflow, Pytorch, H2o, etc.) or language wrappers (Python, Java, etc.) into production REST/GRPC microservices.

Seldon handles scaling to thousands of production machine learning models and provides advanced machine learning capabilities out of the box including Advanced Metrics, Request Logging, Explainers, Outlier Detectors, A/B Tests, Canaries and more.
