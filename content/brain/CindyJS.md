[CindyJS](https://cindyjs.org/)

CindyJS is a framework to create interactive (mathematical) content for the web.

It aims to be compatible with Cinderella, providing an interpreter for the scripting language CindyScript as well as a set of geometric operations which can be used to describe constructions. Together, these components make it very easy to visualize various concepts, from geometry in particular and mathematics in general, but also from various other fields.
