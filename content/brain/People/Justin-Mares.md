I’m on a mission to improve the health and wellness of 1mm+ people over the next decade. The healthcare and food systems in the US are totally f*cked, and I want to change that by launching companies that contribute to a healthier America. As of now (June 2019), that includes launching Kettle & Fire and Perfect Keto.

Co-wrote Traction.

I’m the founder + CEO of Kettle & Fire, the fastest-growing bone broth brand in the country. I also co-founded Perfect Keto, a food + supplement brand for people going keto.

Outside of those companies (which I spend my time on), I also buy small SaaS businesses (Fomo, Cross-Sell, etc) with my partner Ryan Kulp, and do some investing on the side.
