## I have now moved this to a [awesome-basb repo](https://github.com/rasulkireev/awesome-basb)

Here I will add all the links and resources about "Building the second Brain".

This information is extremely valuable, but the actual course is expensive. If you have the money, take the course. If you don't, there are a lot of resources that can help you get started for free.

## [Building a Second Brain: Overview](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/basboverview/)

> Great article! No actionable points on using tools to achieve ideas, but that is not why it was written. Here Tiago goes over the main concepts.

> This is quite meta, but it is very hard make specific excerpts or notes on this piece. The reason is that most of it is gold. This is simply an outline of Tiago's approach an this argument as to why you should use it. It is very convincing. Give it a read.
