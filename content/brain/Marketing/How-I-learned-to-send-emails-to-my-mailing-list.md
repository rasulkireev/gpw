From [Michal Mazurek](https://syften.com) newsletter - [How I learned to send emails to my mailing list](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwJWXWMsntNxHtvZQLlVlPkDFMV)

I didn’t spam all groups at once. I posted to a new one only once I’ve incorporated feedback I received previously. That way I went through around 15 iterations.

> Patience is key. That way you know you won't get same feedback twice.
