How can I make non-stick pans last longer?

Simple: don't clean them in a dishwasher, and don't subject them to extreme heat – ie: above 180º in the oven, or on your hottest burner at full whack. That's true whether you're using induction, gas or ceramic. 

Non-stick pans are really designed for use on low to moderate heat. The best ones conduct heat so well that this is all they need. You can turn the heat right up for short periods to sear meat, but for maximum longevity, don't do this for more than a minute or so. Use a cast iron pan instead if you're into ultra-manly, mega-heat-based cooking.

A happy side effect of cooking on a slightly lower heat is that cleaning is much easier, so you can do it by hand. With more expensive pans you can practically get away with a quick wipe with a tea towel after some meals.

Oh, and for god's sake, don't turn up the burner so flame (or the edges of a halogen hob) extend beyond the base of the pan. That's like farting in a lift. With an induction hob, you can't heat beyond the edge of a pan, so they're fully safe in that respect.
