* Do this project - ask Derek about where I can find it 

* If you want to do many different things and don't get good at any here is the solution. Think long term. Don't think you have to do everything in one year. You can focus on one thing for a couple of years. Then on next, then on next. Dont be a donkey - fable, think of the future
