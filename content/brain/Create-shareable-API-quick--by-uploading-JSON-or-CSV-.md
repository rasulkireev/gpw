I have a json file of quotes collected by Tolstoy. I want to schedule a AWS Lambda function to send it daily.

I need to read the file in the function, so I need to turn JSON to a shareable API.

If this could be done quickly I would pay $1 for that.

-----
When going live,will probably need to start with the version where the API is closed, so that aonly person with the API key can read this.
