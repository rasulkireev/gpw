About the website

The Data Visualisation Catalogue is a project developed by Severino Ribecca to create a library of different information visualisation types.

Originally, this project was a way for me to develop my own knowledge of data visualisation and create a reference tool for me to use in the future for my own work. However, I felt it would also be beneficial to both designers and also anyone in a field that requires the use of data visualisation.

Each visualisation method was added bit-by-bit, as I individually researched each method, to find the best way to explain how it works and what it is best suited for.

Most of the data visualised in the website's example images is dummy data.
