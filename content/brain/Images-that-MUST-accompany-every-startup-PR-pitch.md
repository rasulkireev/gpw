I‚Äôd recommend including *at least* one of these image types, ideally, all four:

ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Hero Shot
Hopefully, you have a product that looks cool. Minimally, you‚Äôll have a clean image that explains your product‚Äôs value proposition. Pictures *are* worth a thousand words ‚Äî invest in them

üèôÔ∏è The Office Logo
A reasonable alternative to the ‚Äúhero shot‚Äù is a photo of the founders against the backdrop of a semi-artful logo in your startup‚Äôs well-lit lobby. Even a photo of the logo in your office can be a decent option.

ü¶Å The Logo in the Wild
A photo of your logo out in the world is a powerful asset. The context clues help explain to potential readers what your startup does, and it demonstrates you‚Äôve actually built something.

üé® The Illustrated Logo
If you don‚Äôt have the time/budget to make rich visual assets, at least ensure that you prep a high-resolution version of your logo.

Another easy option is to put your logo over a piece of stock art that provides some context. Get a free image from Unsplash, add a couple of adjustment layers in Photoshop, and you‚Äôve got a decent press image.

üíª Logo on a screen

üé≠ Logo on a stage

Your logo presented on a large screen at a conference is a decent option for businesses with ephemeral offerings. Like the logo in the wild, it suggests that *someone* thinks you are important enough to put on stage.

‚úèÔ∏è Logos with Illustrations

üì£ Mascots
If your product is dull, but you‚Äôve got a playful spirit, it‚Äôs an underutilized way to build affinity and recognition.

* Avoid stock art sterility at all costs!
* If you want PR, invest in design
