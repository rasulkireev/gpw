[Why Figma Wins](https://kwokchain.com/2020/06/19/why-figma-wins/) by [kwokchain](https://kwokchain.com/)

Companies are a sequencing of loops. While it’s possible to stumble into an initial core loop that works, the companies that are successful in the long term are the ones that can repeatedly find the next loop. However, this evolution is poorly understood relative to its existential impact on a company’s trajectory. Figma is a prime example of sequencing loops. They’re now widely viewed as successful, but the key factors in their success and what bets they must make to get to the next level are less widely understood.

> Good post to reference as a reason to switch to Figma.
