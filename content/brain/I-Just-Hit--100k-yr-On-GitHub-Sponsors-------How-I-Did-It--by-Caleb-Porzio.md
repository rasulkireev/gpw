Here’s how Sponsorware works:

* Create a cool piece of software
* Make it exclusive to people who sponsor you until you reach a certain number of sponsors
* Then open source the project to the world


---

> (To make all this happen I built a Laravel app with GitHub authentication that calls on the GitHub API to verify a user’s sponsorship)
Now, people watching the screencasts will naturally encounter these “private” screencasts and if they like the free ones, they will sponsor me (at $14/mo.) to get access.

---

> All of this works because I spent years and years honing my craft and producing software that is truly useful.

There is just no way around this. You have to learn and gain experience!

---

> The work people are sponsoring for has to be quality and remain the #1 priority.

---

> Building an audience is ESSENTIAL for any of this to work. Twitter followers and email subscribers are your most valuable asset

---

> The biggest mistake people make with GitHub sponsors is offering too small of a first tier.
