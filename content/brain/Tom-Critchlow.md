Digital Garden

Discovered him a while back. He was the one to inspire me to learn web dev.

I do consulting work for startups & media companies. Read more about that here.

I'm passionate about art & technology and am co-founder of Brooklyn art collective Fiercely Curious.

I also know a little kung fu (but I'm rusty)

This is my personal digital garden. A wild garden, loosely tended. There's drafts, ideas, partials, fragments and ideas.
