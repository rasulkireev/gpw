## Action #1: Write a Daily List of Things That Matter

> When we write things down, they become less stressful and easier to prioritize.

> A DAILY LIST HELPS BUILD (AND MAINTAIN) MOMENTUM AND MOTIVATION. Writing  a  list  of  just  a  few  items  —  the  things  that  are  most  important  for  today  —  and  crossing  all  of  them  off  is  far  more  motivational than crossing those same few items off a list with dozens of items on it.

## Action #2: Actually Make Sleep as Important as We Always Pretend It Is.

## Action #3: Put Your Phone Down and Act Like a Person.

> Smartphones are great at solving problems that were caused by smartphones.
