The term “static” can be a little overloaded, and occasionally a little misleading. Here's how I'd define it:
> A static website is a website where the initial HTML is prepared ahead of time, not dynamically generated by a server on request.

For pages consisting mostly of user-specific data, like an analytics dashboard, we probably don't want to do this (especially if that data is private/sensitive).

RK: Static would solve a problem where being on HN kills your site.
