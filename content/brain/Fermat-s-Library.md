[Fermat’s Library](https://fermatslibrary.com/)

We develop software to help illuminate academic papers. Just as Pierre de Fermat scribbled his famous last theorem in the margins, professional scientists, academics and citizen scientists can annotate equations, figures, ideas and write in the margins.


Margins
Upload, annotate and share your papers with anyone. This is Evernote for your papers.

Librarian
A chrome extension that enhances arXiv papers. Get links to references, bibtex extraction and comments on all arXiv papers. 

Journal Club
Featured papers annotated by the Fermat’s Library community every week
