\#2 - Cross Post.
	Once you send, cross post on Twitter (IH, etc.)
\#3 - Add Opt-in everywhere (podcast episodes, youtube videos.)
	Do this by content upgrade. i.e. downloadable PDF.
\#4 - Share with people with large # of followers
\#5 - Make a noclick newsletter
	Don't make people click away from the newsletter. So, no "Click her for more" buttons.
	This will help people spread the newlsetter itself, as opposed to links.
