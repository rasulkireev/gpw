## Lesson 1 - Intro to Valuation 

Problems in valuation:
1. Bias
2. Uncertainty

Compares investing to lemmings jumping of a cliff. 

Valuation is like a life west. It doesn’t mean you won’t make mistakes, it will just make them slower and hurt less. Gives your rational side a chance to speak. 

In models the numbers are estimates and therefore can’t be counted on being fully objective. 

Less is more. If you can value a company with 3 parameters , don’t go looking for five. 

There are three approaches to valuation 
* Intrinsic Valuation (fundamentals, it’s all about the business)
Basically present value of all expected cash flows

* Relative Valuation (looking at prices for similar companies)
* Option pricing models based on contingent cash flows. Essentially cash flows that are dependent on a certain event (fda approval, oil price going up, etc)
