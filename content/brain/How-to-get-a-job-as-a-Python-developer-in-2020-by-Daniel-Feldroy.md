## 1. Writing and Communication
	* Spell and grammar check your resume (sounds silly, but crucial)
	* Join local language groups to improve spoken word
	* For video interview, make sure there is no background noise
		* If you offered to reshedule because of an issue like that, take them up on that offer
	* Look presentable on video interview
	* Make sure background is presentable

## 2. Public Persona 
	* Sometimes employers look at social profiles 

## 3. Quality of Code
	* PEP8 Compliant code
> Use tools like `black` and `pylint` to make it easier to adhere to the standard
	* Make sure your code is secure
		* Things like fields = "__all__" in Django is not good
	* You want to display history of code by using commits
		* There needs to be many of them, otherwise it may seem as code is not yours
		* Messages need to be at least half decent
