# IV - Introduction to Vuex

In Flux architectures, mutation string types are often declared in capital letters to distinguish them from other functions and for tooling/linting purposes.

Itâ€™s important to
reiterate that mutations always have access to state as the first argument.


# V - Vuex and Servers

"We know a fully-defined Vuex store is composed of 4 distinct pieces - state, mutations, actions, and getters. We'll set up the store in steps: 1. Create our state objects 2. Set up the mutations that will occur in our application 3. Create the actions that will commit to these subsequent mutations 4. Create getters for components to directly compute state data" (Hassan Djirdeh 2019:174)
