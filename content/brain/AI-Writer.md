> AI|Writer is an experiment using artificial intelligence to create simulated hypothetical correspondence with famous personalities, both real and fictitious.

> The AI is provided by OpenAI’s API and will use publicly available information about that person to try to respond in their written voice. 

> You can ask simple and complex questions. There’s an upper limit of about 300 words to what the AI will respond to.

> Just like real people, characters will respond based upon how compelling your message is to them. If the real character was known to be brusque, the virtual version will be as well.

> Characters rarely reply to the same question in the same way. You can ask a question again and will likely get a different response.
