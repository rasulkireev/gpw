> Don't take it personally when someone gives you a lowball offer, it's just business. You're free to decline bad offers and hold out for what you think the project is worth, or take the deal if it's close enough.

> No-code projects surprisingly can fetch a higher price than code projects because no-code projects have a larger potential market of acquirers. To sell a code project the buyer has to be able to program themselves (in the same languages you used) or have the money to hire someone who can. That narrows down how many people can buy your side project.
