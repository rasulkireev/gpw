Now the next step is making connections between the words. That is where SCAMPER comes in.

From [Wikipedia - SCAMPER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.C.A.M.P.E.R)
> SCAMPER is an acronym that provides a structured way of assisting students to think out of the box and enhance their knowledge.
It is thought to protect students' creativity as they mature.

> SCAMPER is an activity-based thinking process that can be performed by Cooperative learning. Here the teacher assists the students in choosing a particular topic and helps them to develop it through a structured process. After choosing an idea, the students are given a tale where they perform the activity in steps corresponding to the letters in the name. 

> * *Substitute* comes up with another topic that is equivalent to the present topics.

In our context how can we subsutute a part of the item from one listen with the item in another.

> * *Combine* adds information to the original topic.

> * *Adjust* identifies ways to construct the topic in a more flexible and adjusted material.

> * *Modify, magnify, minify* creatively changes the topic or makes a feature/idea bigger or smaller.

> * *Put* to other uses identifies the possible scenarios and situations where this topic can be used.

> * *Eliminate* removes ideas or elements from the topic that are not valuable.

> * *Reverse*, rearrange evolves a new concept from the original concept.

> Everything is a box. Learn to draw boxes and you can draw many things

Same with circles, right. So if you can draw circles and boxes you must be a drawing god!

After doing a light sketch Maggie erases the sketch with a light eraser and draws on top of the "shadow" that is left.
