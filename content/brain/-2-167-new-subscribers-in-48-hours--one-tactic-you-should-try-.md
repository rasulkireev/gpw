The key was the content strategy.

I won't lie: it requires a lot of work.
But it can be replicated in any niche.
So we thought we'd share the tactic with the IH community.🎉

The technique is called "R.L.L." (Really Long List).
It was invented by Brian Dean from Backlinko.

He describes the RLL technique in detail in his latest course.

I'll give you a quick overview in 6 steps:

1. 🕵 USER RESEARCH: Guess < Ask

You just have to find the equivalent for your niche.
But please: don't just try to guess.
Ask directly.

2. ✨ Quality - TOPIC: Offer a clear benefit for a niche.

There are BILLIONS of "5 Ways To _" list-posts out on the web.
But very few "100+ Tactics For _" high-quality articles.
Especially ones with clear benefits for a specific niche.

3. 🧠 Value
 
Focus on providing examples, tips, and checklists that people can use.

4. 🏡 Structure - Easy to scan = easy to share.

* Use categories.
* Reduce [cognitive load](https://growth.design/psychology/#cognitive-load).
* Use progressive disclosure.
* Aim for a clear visual hierarchy.

5. 📝 Create

Writing one HUGE LIST is extremely hard.
But creating one list ITEM is easy.

6. 📬 Convert

Content upgrades tap into the concept of [curiosity gaps](https://growth.design/psychology/#curiosity-gap) 🔗 .
That alone attracted thousands of emails.

* Treat your free content like a paid product.
* Build in small iterations.
* Get started now
