THE FUNDAMENTALS
1. The Surprising Power of Atomics Habits
    * Habits are like compound interest. They grow exponentially if enough time is given. Therefore you need to be patient. If you get 1% better each day for a year. You’ll end up 37 times better by the end of the year.
2. How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
    * There are 3 levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change. The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become (identity change).
    * By changing your habits you change beliefs about yourself (if you write every day, you are a write).
3. How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
    * Any Habit can be broken up into 4 steps: Cue, Caving, Response, and a Reward. (Example: Cue - You are answering emails, Craving - You begin to feel stressed and overwhelmed. You want to feel in control. Response - You bite you nails. Reward - You satisfy your craving to reduce stress. Biting your nails becomes associated with answering email.)
    * The Four Laws of Behavior Change is a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits
        1. Make it obvious (Cue)
        2. Make it attractive (Craving)
        3. Make it easy (Response)
        4. Make it satisfying (Reward)

THE 1ST LAW: MAKE IT OBVIOUS
4. The Man Who Didn’t Look Right
    * The Process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
    * "The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise to help you become aware of you behavior. To create you own, make a list of your daily habits.” Then, put a plus, a minus or an equal sign to determine if the habit is positive, negative or neutral in the long run.
5. The Best Way to Start a New Habit
    * Implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with specific time and time and location. “I WILL [BEHAVIOR] AT [TIME] IN [LOCATION].
    * Habit Stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit. “AFTER [CURRENT HABIT], I WILL [NEW HABIT].
6. Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
