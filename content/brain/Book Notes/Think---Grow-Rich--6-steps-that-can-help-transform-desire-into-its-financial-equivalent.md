I want to have $1,000,000 by the age of 30. I will acquire this amount of money by selling good (books, accessories and other merchandise). To do that I will read many books on e-commerce, internet business, etc., then I will create a website for that, contact people/ shops who will help me sell those things and persuade them to do so. We will interest people in buying from us by making outstanding customer service, fast deliveries and security of transactions.
