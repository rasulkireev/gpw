I'm a writer and researcher who likes to understand how people work. I try to engage in both theory and practice, which means I'm always cycling between writing to understand a topic, then finding ways to test those ideas in the "real world."

I'm currently interested in parasocial communities and reputation-based economies. I work at Substack.

Previously, I focused on open source software, working independently and at GitHub to improve the developer experience. I recently published a book about open source developers called Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software (available now).
