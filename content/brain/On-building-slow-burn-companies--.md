A tough economy is a great time to build a slow burn company.

* This may be a side hustleâ€¦
* An open source project
* Or a slow burn startup ðŸ”¥
    

Some of my faves: @mailchimp, @airtable, @github, @glossier

How do you build a slow burn company?  Some characteristics:

* Single, simple use case
* Small (often developer-led) team
* User acquisition is cheap, simple, self-serviceMargins sustain growth
* Strong community-driven support

Slow growth <-> slow burn
Fast growth <-> fast burn

Slow growth must be paired with low burn, or you squander your natural organic growth advantages. 

Some categories of slow burn companies you could play around with:

* Communities
* Open source projects
* Bottoms up markets
* Low ticket SaaS
* Developer evangelized tools

With any company, but slow burn companies especially, it always helps to build from first principles:

* Solve a real pain point
* Have unit & growth economics that work
* Build a dramatically, not just incrementally better product
* Surround yourself with the best people
