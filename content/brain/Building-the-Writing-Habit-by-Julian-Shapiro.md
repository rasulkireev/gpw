> The best way to think is by writing. It compels your brain to connect the dots.

Can't even count the number of times I was writing a question, only to figure it out myself, while writing it.

You don't need multiple novel ideas to start. Ideas will naturally emerge from the process of writing:

    Choose a topic
    Write your intro, and use it to brainstorm talking points
    Get feedback on your intro
    Create a starting outline
    Explore talking points within your outline
    Rewrite for clarity, succinctness, and intrigue
    Cycle between rewriting, resting, and receiving feedback
    Copy edit for grammar, word choice, and flow
    There are many good ways to tell a story. Be satisfied when youâ€™ve found one that you'd want to read yourself.

> Don't practice writing by aiming for a weekly output of words or posts. Word count is a dumb goal that measures your output volume instead of your output quality.
Heck, rewriting often reduces your word count.
Instead, focus on improving the clarity of your thinking and your eye for rewriting.
