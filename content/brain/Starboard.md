 Introducing Starboard Notebook

Starboard brings cell-by-cell notebooks to the browser, no code is running on the backend here! It's probably the quickest way to visualize some data with interactivity, do some prototyping, or build a rudimentary dashboard.
Some features

    Mix Markdown, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
    The file format is a plaintext file, which plays nice with version control systems like git.
    Runs entirely in your browser, everything is static: no server, no setup and no build step.
