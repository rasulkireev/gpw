Idea came while reading [this post](https://florian-dahlitz.de/blog/build-a-markdown-to-html-conversion-pipeline-using-python).

Basically a person, startup, or a compnay has to only worry about the copy. They write it in markdown, upload to service and a web page is generated.

They won't be able to configure styling, only text. Potentially I could offer multiple themes for a price for each.

The site can be a single page only! Sections are determined using markdown tags. That way the app will know when the user talks about Pricing, or Testimonials. 

Could charge for theme usage, custom domain.
