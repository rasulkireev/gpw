[The Art of Deal Making  / Negotiation - Tim Ferriss](https://youtu.be/z3U0FRb9yr4)

1. He or she who cares the least wins 
  * Having options is very helpful when negotiating 
  * this can be faked by fear setting exercise 

2. Start by asking to put something on the table first 
  * you are an expert , you did it a million times 
  * this opens up an opportunity to **flinch**, make a “painful” face as if to say, ooh, that’s too much/little
  * this can be mimicked by pause.... then wait.... (waiting is the hardest), then

3. Is that the best you can do?
