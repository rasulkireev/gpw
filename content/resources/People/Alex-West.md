I'm Alex, and probably just like you, I have a goal I'm working towards. Mine is to achieve financial independence in 2020.

I'm working full time, as an engineer on a device NASA astronauts will wear when they go to Mars.

In the past two years, I have launched ~20 products and made 4 of them profitable.

I've reached $800 MRR so far. My goal is to reach $2k MRR.
