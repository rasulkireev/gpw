[Passion - 4:00]
After discussion with Rober Greene

1) Whatever you do when you are 11 or 12 and no one (parens / teachers) made you do it, that is your passion. 

	You can easily forget what was something you really enjoyed when you were twelve. Life happens, other things happen, college, for example. If you prents can help you remind what you enjoyed the most when you were 11-12 that would be fantastic.

2) What would you do for work if you weren't paid for. That might be your passion.
