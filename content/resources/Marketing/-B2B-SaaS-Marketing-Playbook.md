Growth Marketing Strategies for B2B SaaS Founders
(b29c72963ef340d09e85c78125fb5c99)

### Behind the Book

I started coding in 2009.

Every time that I would finish a project my attention would turn to how to get users. 

Aside from this strategy being backwards, there werenâ€™t any concise, actionable guides on how to get users for my project. 

Since then, Iâ€™ve stopped waiting until I was finished coding to market. And I started writing the book I wish existed.

The no-fluff, tactical playbook on how companies are getting users. 

Think of it as an annotated swipe file (or lookbook).

This book is a buffet of strategy. Take what makes sense for your project and leave what doesnâ€™t. Use it as a reference or read all the way through.
