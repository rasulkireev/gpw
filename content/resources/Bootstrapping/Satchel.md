Make more informed decisions about SaaS.
Here at Satchel, we write SaaS buying guides. We try to identify the best-of-category tool for a typical early-stage startup based on rigorous, hands-on testing and standardized assessments. Along the way, we uncover and share info that should be obvious (but isn't), and point out any caveats and pitfalls you might encounter.
Our priority is to remain unbiased and reliable. We have no financial relationship with any of the products that we write about. We operate free of influence from any external organization or company. Learn More
