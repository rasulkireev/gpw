From Arsene Wenger The Biography

"Discipline, a way with words, a willingness to work hard, and a respected confidence in others - it may come across as a bit naive, but it has paid dividends over time!", "These values allowed me to be appreciated anywhere."

"Language has a real influence on the spirit and culture of people."
