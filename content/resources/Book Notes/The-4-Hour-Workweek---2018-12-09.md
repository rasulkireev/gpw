* First and Foremost
* D - Definition
    * Cautions and Comparisons:
            The goal is to become a New Rich (NR). The goal is not to be a millionaire, but to live like one. This means freeing up time to do things that you enjoy, whatever that is.

    * Rules that Change the Rules:
        1. Retirement is Worst-Case-Scenario Insurance
        2. Interest and Energy are Cyclical.
            * Alternating periods of activity and rest is necessary.
        3. Less Is Not Laziness. 
            * Doing less meaningless work, so that you can focus on things of greater personal importance, is NOT laziness.
        4. The Timing is Never Right.
        5. Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission. 
            * If it isn’t going to devastate those around you, try it and then justify it.
        6.  Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses.
        7. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite. 
            * It is possible to have too much of a good thing.
        8. Money Alone Is Not the Solution.
        9. Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income.
            * Relative Income uses two variables: the dollar and time (usually hours). So, it is important to see how much each hour of your work brings you in money.
        10. Distress Is Bad, Eustress Is Good.
            * Distress refers to harmful stimuli that make you weaker, less confident, and less able. Destructive criticism, abusive bosses, and smashing your face on a curb are examples of this. These are things we want to avoid.
            * Eustress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably never heard. Eu-, a Greek prefix for “healthy,” is used in the same sense in the word “euphoria.” Role models who push us to exceed our limits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable action are all examples of eustress—stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth.

    * Dodging Bullets:
So… What is the worst that could happen?
Write down your answers, and keep in mind that thinking a lot will not prove as fruitful or as prolific as simply brain vomiting on the page. Write and do not edit—aim for volume. Spend a few minutes on each answer. Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are considering.
1. What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if temporarily?
2. What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios? Now that you’ve defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or definite positive outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.) or external?
3. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control?
4. What are you putting off out of fear?
5. What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to do. That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might be—it is fear of unknown outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do it.
6. What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action?
7. What are you waiting for? If you cannot answer this without resorting to the previously rejected concept of good timing, the answer is simple: You’re afraid, just like the rest of the world.
"What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do."
    * System Reset:
                        Doing the Unrealistic is easier than doing the realistic. 
                        Do dreamlining. Tim recommends doing an automatic calculators and forms at fourhourblog.com and referring to the model worksheet as the following steps are completed.  
    1. What would you do if there were no way you could fail? If you were 10 times smarter than the rest of the world? Create two timelines—6 months and 12 months—and list up to five things you dream of having (including, but not limited to, material wants: house, car, clothing, etc.), being (be a great cook, be fluent in Chinese, etc.), and doing (visiting Thailand, tracing your roots overseas, racing ostriches, etc.) in that order. If you have difficulty identifying what you want in some categories, as most will, consider what you hate or fear in each and write down the opposite. Do not limit yourself, and do not concern yourself with how these things will be accomplished. For now, it’s unimportant. This is an exercise in reversing repression.
    2. Drawing a blank? For all their bitching about what’s holding them back, most people have a lot of trouble coming up with the defined dreams they’re being held from. This is particularly true with the “doing” category. In that case, consider these questions: What would you do, day to day, if you had $100 million in the bank? What would make you most excited to wake up in the morning to another day? Don’t rush—think about it for a few minutes. If still blocked, fill in the five “doing” spots with the following: one place to visit one thing to do before you die (a memory of a lifetime) one thing to do daily one thing to do weekly one thing you’ve always wanted to learn
    3. What does “being” entail doing? Convert each “being” into a “doing” to make it actionable. Identify an action that would characterize this state of being or a task that would mean you had achieved it. People find it easier to brainstorm “being” first, but this column is just a temporary holding spot for “doing” actions. Here are a few examples: Great cook make Christmas dinner without help Fluent in Chinese have a five-minute conversation    with a Chinese co-worker.
    4. What are the four dreams that would change it all? Using the 6-month timeline, star or otherwise highlight the four most exciting and/or important dreams from all columns. Repeat the process with the 12-month timeline if desired.
    5. Determine the cost of these dreams and calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for both timelines. If financeable, what is the cost per month for each of the four dreams (rent, mortgage, payment plan installments, etc.)? Start thinking of income and expense in terms of monthly cash flow—dollars in and dollars out—instead of grand totals. Things often cost much, much less than expected. For example, a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder, fresh off the showroom floor at $260,000, can be had for $2,897.80 per month. I found my personal favorite, an Aston Martin DB9 with 1,000 miles on it, through eBay for $136,000—$2,003.10 per month. How about a Round-the-World trip (Los Angeles Tokyo Singapore Bangkok Delhi or Bombay London Frankfurt Los Angeles) for $1,399? For some of these costs, the Tools and Tricks at the end of Chapter 14 will help.
        * Last, calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for realizing these dreamlines. This is how to do it: First, total each of the columns A, B, and C, counting only the four selected dreams. Some of these column totals could be zero, which is fine. Next, add your total monthly expenses x 1.3 (the 1.3 represents your expenses plus a 30% buffer for safety or savings). This grand total is your TMI and the target to keep in mind for the rest of the book. I like to further divide this TMI by 30 to get my TDI—Target Daily Income. I find it easier to work with a daily goal. Online calculators on our companion site do all the work for you and make this step a cinch. Chances are that the figure is lower than expected, and it often decreases over time as you trade more and more “having” for once-in-a-lifetime “doing.” Mobility encourages this trend.
    6. Determine three steps for each of the four dreams in just the 6-month timeline and take the first step now. I’m not a big believer in long-term planning and far-off goals. In fact, I generally set 3-month and 6-month dreamlines. The variables change too much and in-the-future distance becomes an excuse for postponing action. The objective of this exercise isn’t, therefore, to outline every step from start to finish, but to define the end goal, the required vehicle to achieve them (TMI, TDI), and build momentum with critical first steps
        * First, let’s focus on those critical first steps. Define three steps for each dream that will get you closer to its actualization. Set actions—simple, well-defined actions—for now, tomorrow (complete before 11 A.M.) and the day after (again completed before 11 A.M.).
        * Once you have three steps for each of the four goals, complete the three actions in the “now” column. Do it now. Each should be simple enough to do in five minutes or less. If not, rachet it down. If it’s the middle of the night and you can’t call someone, do something else now, such as send an e-mail, and set the call for first thing tomorrow.
        * If the next stage is some form of research, get in touch with someone who knows the answer instead of spending too much time in books or online, which can turn into paralysis by analysis. The best first step, the one I recommend, is finding someone who’s done it and ask for advice on how to do the same. It’s not hard.

"What is the opposite of happiness? Sadness? No. Just as love and hate are two sides of the same coin, so are happiness and sadness. Crying out of happiness is a perfect illustration of this. The opposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness is—here’s the clincher—boredom. Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all.”

* E - Elimination
    * The End of Time Management:
                        We often end up creating busyness (Outlook checking, Instagram, Email, etc.) when we really should be prioritizing.
“Effectiveness is doing the things that get you closer to your goals. Efficiency is performing a given task (whether important or not) in the most economical manner possible. Being efficient without regard to effectiveness is the default mode of the universe.” 
“Doing something unimportant well does not make it important. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important.” 
What you do is infinitely more important than how you do it. 
Being busy is a form of laziness - lazy thinking and indiscriminate action. 
    The Pareto rule (80/20): Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness? And vice versa.
    The Parkinson’s Law: Since we have 8 hours to feel, we fill 8 hours. We would fill 15 if we had to. When there is an emergency, suddenly we are able to do the job quicker… 
                So. The 2 synergetic approaches to increase productivity would be (best to use both):
            * Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20). (i.e. Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income) 
            * Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson’s Law). (i.e. Schedule the tasks with very short and clear deadlines)

    * The Low-Information Diet:
            This is pretty straight forward. Proposed solution:
            1. Go on an immediate one-week media fast. Cold Turkey. No news, newspapers, tv, non music radio, non fiction books, except for this one, youtube (except for one hour for pleasure), etc. Instead of newspaper, talk to spouse. Then do your work. If complete, do excercises from this book. ( Get the news fix for five minutes at lunch).
            2. Develop a habit asking yourself, “Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important”?
            3. Practice the art of non finishing. (e.g. If you are reading an article that sucks, put it down.) 

    * Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal:
"For our purposes, an interruption is anything that prevents the start-to-finish completion of a critical task, and there are three principal offenders: 

Time wasters: those things that can be ignored with little or no consequence. Common time wasters include meetings, discussions, phone calls, web surfing, and e-mail that are unimportant.
    Chapter on time wasters talks about polite ways to teach colleagues and boss to be more efficient with email, phone calls and meeting. There are some useful templates in the chapter.

Time consumers: repetitive tasks or requests that need to be completed but often interrupt high-level work. Here are a few you might know intimately: reading and responding to e-mail, making and returning phone calls, customer service (order status, product assistance, etc.), financial or sales reporting, personal errands, all necessary repeated actions and tasks."
For dealing with time consumers. Batching is the way to go ( do the time consuming task all at once (e.g. Laundry, email replies))

"Empowerment failures: instances where someone needs approval to make something small happen. Here are just a few: fixing customer problems (lost shipments, damaged shipments, malfunctions, etc.), customer contact, cash expenditures of all types."
