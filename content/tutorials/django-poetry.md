Update (02/03/2022): I wrote an [updated guide on how to create a django project with poetry](https://builtwithdjango.com/blog/basic-django-setup) for the builtwithdjango site. It focuses on creating a project with poetry. In the future I will also write a guide on how to migrate a project to poetry.

Poetry is relatively new packaging and dependency manager. It makes it very easy to upload libraries to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), manage dependencies visually, and has a couple of handy features. Today, I'm not going to do a deep dive into how [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) works and all its features. Today I just want to focus on configuring a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project.

## 1. Install Poetry

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

## 2. Create a Directory for you Django Project

```bash
mkdir django_poetry_example && ls django_poetry_example
```

## 3. Initiate a Poetry Project

```bash
poetry init
```

You will be asked to confirm the information about your project. You can skip through most of it.

## 4. Add the Necessary Dependencies

Run `poetry add django`. Poetry will add `django` to the `pyproject.toml` file under the dependencies section. A virtual environment will also be created for you.

## 5. Start you Django Project

```
django-admin startproject django_poetry_example .
```

## 6. Working on your Django Project

When you need to run any python function (for example, `python manage.py createsuperuser`) you have two options.

1. You can leverage `poetry run`, which will run against the current project's dependencies. The command will be this: `poetry run python manage.py createsuperuser`.
2. You can activate the virtual environment with a `poetry shell` command. Now you can run python commands, as is. They will be run with dependencies you have installed.

## Bonus. Export dependencies to a requirements.txt

If you need to have the `requirements.txt` file with all the dependencies, you can run `poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt`. If you have configured a CI/CD job that auto deploys your project, you can add this function as a step, which will generate the updated version on each update.

## Bonus II. Video

If you prefer a more visual approach, I have made a video that shows how to start a Django project with Poetry.
