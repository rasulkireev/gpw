description: Launching a new hobby project. I am making a curated list of products built with Django.
---

Last week, I purchased [Ryan Kulp](https://www.ryanckulp.com/)'s course on buying, improving, and selling microbusinesses [(affiliate link)](https://www.microacquisitions.com/how-to-buy-small-companies/8ayt5). One of the reasons I bought this course was to learn another skill (bseides, data analysis and web developemnt) he help my on a path to become financially independent. The other reason is that I desperately wanted to see how one would purchase a business without having a ton of cash upfront. Finally, I have been following Ryan for a while now, and he is just a cool dude, with [a lot to share](https://www.ryanckulp.com/projects/).

This is not a post about this course, though. I will write a short review of the course once I finish it. For now, I want to share a new project I am working on and how I came up with it.

The reason I mentioned How to Buy, Grow, and Sell Small Companies is that it helped me to get the idea. In one of the videos, Ryan said that at [Fork Equity](https://www.forkequity.com/)(Ryan's Investment firm), they care about the tech stack that the company uses. They have experience with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and will be able to navigate in the projects once they acquire it quickly. I am a big fan of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and its [community](https://www.djangoproject.com/community/). If I am ever going to buy a business, I do not want to spend a ton of time learning the tech stack behind it. So I thought it would be cool to have a collection of websites built with Django. Hence my project "[Built with Django](https://builtwithdjango.com/)."

This seemed like an excellent idea for several reasons:
1. I get to practice and improve my Django & Design skills
2. I get to create a community of like-minded people. More specifically, people who like to create things and like to create them with Django.
3. I have a list of great projects that I could potentially help with or even take under my wing and improve upon.
4. Highlight the brightest mind in the community that I love.
5. In case of success, potentially monetize, by creating a job board and other non-intrusive to users way.

The project is now up and running. I published it a week ago. I will not go into more detail about how I was making right now. I will write a post on it later.

Here I just want to state that it took me about a week to go from 0 to [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). The hardest part was the front end, it is my weakness. Otherwise, Django makes it pretty easy to build the backend logic. Love Django.

I think this is going to be relatively low maintenance, yet useful project. I hope we get some people sharing their work. Hopefully, this will help grow the awesome community of Django makers.
