I have been slowly implementing "[Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)" (BASB) technique into my personal life. I'm doing this slowly, step-by-step. For me, any past attempts to make my life more productive, with Evernote, Pocket, or other tools, have been a failure because they have been too overwhelming. More than that, I did not have a great starting point, I had to design my flow from scratch.

This time around, I have [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/) and [David Perell](https://www.perell.com/), their learnings and writings have been an enormous inspiration. They both have courses that seem great and totally worth it. For me, the price point is a little out of my range (for know). Luckily, they have been putting a lot of content out there. That content is so valuable, it makes me wonder what do they offer during their course. I am preparing a consolidateCreatedd list of links, articles, videos, and other types of resources that those two have put out there. Stay tuned.

Today, I wanted to discuss how I use Pocket and how it integrates into the BASB flow.

## Method


It is actually pretty simple. After I finish the article, I assign it a tag, "read." This allows me to see all the articles that I have finished.

I then transfer all the notes and summarizations to Joplin.

> Joplin is very simple to Evernote, but with a few differences. Most importantly, it is open-source, which means it is free and is being developed and improved by a lot of people. I go into more detail on Joplin in [my post](https://rasulkireev.com/writings/joplin).

After I am done transferring highlights, I assign that post a "Joplined" tag (totally made-up word).

## Conclusion

This is not some sort of revolutionary method of note-taking. This is a simple flow I ended up using to make sure that my Pocket articles are not mixed together, and it is easy to navigate.

I think this is the best way of using tags. I never found the use of assigning tasks like "productivity," "writing," or something like that. There is a search button for that.
