description: My Own Personal Space. So Cool.
---

That is so cool! I just published a short post about [Fear and Blogging](https://www.rasulkireev.com/writings/fear-and-blogging) and checked it out straight away. It feels unreal. I just posted something for the entire world to look at. The best thing is that it is my personal space, I can write anything I want and no one will be able to tell me to take it down, no matter what.

I can write here anything I want. I can write and structure it anyway I want. I won't lie to you, this feels amazing! Try it. Use [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [Medium](https://medium.com/) or something else you already now or is easy to use. Once you feel more confident with what you write, make your own website with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to fully claim your personal space on the World Wide Web! I am still only in the beginning of all this and decided to begin with a website, because I was scared to publish my thoughts, but here I am, happy to get started. Hope you will too!
