description: I think that most advice online is bad. You shouldn't listen to anyone but yourself. Here is why...
---

There is a ton prescriptive content online (articles, videos, podcasts, and any other type of media):

- "You should meditate"
- "Why taking a cold shower will change your life"
- "Journaling helped me improve"
- "Don’t drink caffeine"
and that is just a tip of the iceberg. Most of this advice is bullshit.

I’m here to tell you that you shouldn’t follow anyone’s advice.

The reason that most advice online is bullshit is that no one knows you like you do. Only you care enough about yourself to test different ideas and how they affect your life, work and other aspects of your life.

Of course you can look at other successful people for inspiration, but never expect everything to work out the same way it does for them, it won’t.

Do your own “I tried ___ for 30 days and here is what I think” experiment and see if it works for you. Write down your results, or don’t, I don’t know what suits you better.

I think the approach where you are in a life long research mode is the best. Try something new and see if it sticks. If not, go to the next one, if it does, find a way to implement it in your life in a way that will maximize simplicity.

P.S. Ironic that the last paragraph is my advice to you. Feel free to ignore it.
