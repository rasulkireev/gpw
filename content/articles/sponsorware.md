description: Caleb Porzio introduced me to the idea of Sponsorware. I am picking it up. I hope more people will to. In this post I tell you what Sponsorware is and why I think it is the future of open-source.

A couple of months ago, I signed up for [Caleb Porzio](https://calebporzio.com/)'s [newsletter about VS Code](https://learn-vscode.com/). I then rediscovered Caleb through his post on [hitting $100k/y through Github Sponsors](https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it). This post made quite the round across the internet, after all, that's the dream, right?

In this post, he said that one of the spikes was due to the [Sponsorware](https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware). It's not an app or anything, it's just an idea. The idea is that you only let your supporters use your "open-source" work until you reach a certain number of sponsors. Once you reach this level, you make the repo public. That's pretty genius.

I'm very intrigued by this idea and have decided to give it a go. I have applied for the [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/) program. The process is very straight forward. If you do any open-source work, I suggest you apply as well, there is no harm. If you get in, try this Sponsorware thing, I think the future of open-source is very bright if more people adopt this strategy. If I don't get in, no worries, I'll just keep working on my open-source projects until I can get in.

I don't have a huge following my work, but I hope this post will spread. I think that this way of working is very healthy for the developer and for the community alike. I really hope this picks up.

Thanks for reading, have a wonderful day!
