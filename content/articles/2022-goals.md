description: In this post, I want to publicly list all my 2022 goals. This will help keep me accountable.
---

As with my [2021 in Review post](https://rasulkireev.com/2021-in-review/), I am following [Anthony Gustin](https://dranthonygustin.com/)'s [Extensive Review Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K2P_yL1Ah976P7MLicb55wgY2DY-39jP3Lvp810H6HQ/edit#).

### What Do You Want?

#### What type of person do I want to be?
- I want to be a good person. That entails being loving to my family, helping my friends, being kind to all the people. I want to be a very well-disciplined person that doesn't wait for things to happen to him, but rather pursues the goals and things that he wants. I want to do good work that helps people, improves their lives.
- I think I spoke about this in other parts of this review, but at the end of the day, I just want to be a good person.
- Clearly, different people have different ideas of what "good" is. So, perhaps, listing some people I look up to when it comes to being good, would help entail what my idea of good is. So here are some such people:
  - [Jordan O'Connor](https://jdnoc.com/)
  - [Nat Eliason](https://www.nateliason.com/)
  - [Daniel Vassallo](https://dvassallo.com/)
  - [Natalie Nagele](https://twitter.com/natalienagele)
  - [Sahil Lavingia](https://sahillavingia.com/)

- I also want to be a human being that always looks to improve in some way. Be it learning some history, reading some philosophy, building an app to learn a programming language, or anything else that improves me as a human being. This sounds corny to me by now, but I want to be a person that is in a constant beta mode.
- This is not exactly behavior, but I would like to be a person that earns well and provides all the basic needs for his family, and more.

#### Themes
- Being more attentive to my SO (compliments, gifts, etc.)
- Learning
- Health & Exercise
- Finance

I mean, these are pretty regular themes :) We all want the same things I think.

### 2022 Action and Plan

- This is where I take my goals from the last step and think about accountability and completion mechanics. Or in other words, how am I going to ensure that these tasks get done, how am I going to track them?
- I don't want to be too aggressive with my systems as the failure to comply with them might be crushing.
- I like my current approach where I work on a project that kind of feels right.
- Of course, I do have a hard schedule for some tasks. For instance:
	- Personal Newsletter every Tuesday.
	- Django Newsletter Every Friday that I have something to show for.
	- Chess improvements, meetups every Saturday, and 2 tournaments per month. That's around 52 practices + 24 tournaments.
	- Add notes to the Obsidian database every day
	- Do Duolingo exercises every day
	- Exercise every other day
	- Follow the slow carb diet
- Some of these tasks motivate and inspire further work on these projects.
- For other things, I will be waiting for the right time and regularly reviewing the goals. For example, to learn Rust I need a good amount of free time and mental space. For that, I need to finish the NFT project.
- So can't work on all the items, simultaneously, so with every milestone just have to consult my goals to see what can do next.
