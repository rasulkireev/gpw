I just finished writing the "[2019 in Review](https://rasulkireev.com/writings/2019-in-review) " post, where I went over the things that I made happen in 2019. It felt great, I recommend everyone do it.

While writing the post, I kept thinking, "ok, I need to do this in 2020". I think it is a good idea to write down some goals for 2020. Not to always look at them to make sure you accomplish them. Instead, to give you some point of comparison at the end of next year. When I'm writing 2020 in Review, I will be able to see what was important to me at the end of 2019 and what changed during the next year.

So, without further ado, here are a few small goals I have for 2020.

## TL;DR
* Become a better Data Analyst
* Learn and become way more proficient with Web Technology
* Become the master of my mind and life
* Earn some $$$ from a side hustle
* Become more sociable
* Become a more loving husband
* Write more often
* Start a podcast
* Get out of debt
* Buy an existing company
* If 1, 10, and 11 are successful, set up an LLC.

## 1. Build two web apps
I think financial success lies in both quantity and quality. When it comes to building a SaaS product, one doesn't come without the other. If you look at prolific makers like [Josh Pigford](https://joshpigford.com/), [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/), [Mubashar Iqbal](https://mubs.me/), [Tyler Tringas](https://tylertringas.com/), [Justin Jackson](https://justinjackson.ca/), and others, you will see that they have been building for years. That is a huge reason for their current success.

I understand that success doesn't come without Grit, i.e., working and trying without giving up. No matter what, I want to keep building and learning to build better products. Two SaaS projects seem like a doable goal.

## 2. Become a better Data Analyst
I thought becoming a data science is my dream for a long time. Now that I have worked with the new department within Guy Carpenter, I understand I am very far from that. Instead, I want to improve a lot in my position as a Data Analyst.
To be more specific, I want to get more accustomed to working with large datasets via Spark. My goal is not to receive a ton of error every time I try to do anything, and not Google every single idea I have. I need to improve my speed and efficiency drastically.

I also want to become a much better Data storyteller. This is a vital skill not only in a professional setting but very useful in life and personal projects.

## 3. Learn and become way more proficient with Web Technologies
Learn to Stripe. This would mean to learn to integrate Stripe API and Stripe.js into my current and future Django projects. Currently, I just can't figure that out. This doesn't mean I have to become an expert in each APIs and JavaScript, but dealing with Stripe flow will certainly greatly improved my understanding of both.

Actually, I have a list of things I'd like to learn and write posts about. There are a bunch of them actually. Here is a small sample:
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
* [Webmentions](https://indieweb.org/webmention)
* [GraphQl](http://https://graphql.org/)
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) ([Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/))
* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
* [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
* [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html), [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/), and [GIS in general](https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview)
* [Serverless Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing)

Next on the list are webmentions and D3.js. I am going to experiment with both through my personal Website. It should be an interesting and rewarding process.

## 4. Become the master of my mind and life
This is a broad goal, as well. It includes meditation, diet, emotion control, and spending habits.
In an attempt to make this more accountable, I would like to make a goal of:
* Do morning exercise, meditation, and journaling on 70% of mornings in 2020.
* 70% of my weekdays must be sweetless.

I think achieving this will make a massive difference in my life.

## 5. Earn some from a side hustle
It doesn't matter if it just 1 dollar. It is crucial to start. It could be through some consulting, or from a photo shoot, or from one of my web apps. As long as it makes some money.

## 6. Become more sociable
Meet 50 new people. Meeting fellow Indiehackers is the first thing that comes to mind. However, there are a plethora of other people to meet. Django developers, Data Analysts, and Scientists.

With Tanya, we could meet people at board game meetups or photographers meetups, perhaps.

Connections and relationships are everything.

## 7. Become a more loving husband
Show my love to my wife more often. Show her signs of affection and gratitude. Surprise her more often.

Certainly need to try to argue less and do less shouting.

## 8. Write more often
Share my learnings, my explorations, and anything else that could be useful to people. Make at least 50 blog posts in 2020.

## 9. Start a podcast
Start a podcast for Built with Django.

## 10. Get out of Debt
One of the biggest causes of my stress in 2019 is due to shaky finances. We are spending way more than I earn. And I fucking myself for that. That lack of discipline and control very upsetting. So this is a big goal for 2020.

Reducing costs to reflect my income. More importantly, payout all of my debts and loans. Get to zero money owned by April. This is, by far, one of the most important goals for 2020. The only reason it is not #1 is that I somehow thought about it right before posting.

## 11. Buy an existing company
Using learning from Ryan Kulp's microacqusitions class, buy an existing business. Start growing it.

## 12. If 1, 10 and 11 are successful set up an LLC

## Conclusion
I have been thinking about those for a while now. I am pretty sure this is a good and exhaustive list. As I said in the beginning, I don't have the goal of following this list closely. For me, 2020 will be about building good habits.

Achieving those habits will help me get these goals done, and in turn, these goals will help me reinforce my habits. Thus, creating a beautiful circle (of life 😉)

To whoever is reading this, have a Happy New Year. I wish you all the luck and all the strength you can have! May the next year, be the best of your life.
