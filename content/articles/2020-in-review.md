description: This is my attempt to review everything that I made happen, and that happened to me in 2020. It is crucial to remind yourself of the things you regularly did. Writing this post was very gratifying.

I have been postponing publishing this post for a long time now. I have finished reviewing my achievements, goals, and other events of the past year on January 2nd. For some mysterious reason have not published anything.

I am procrastinating out of fear, probably, but it feels that I can't start doing anything meaningful before I publish this review. So here it goes...

The goal of this post is to compare the [goals I had for 2020](https://rasulkireev.com/2020-goals/) with the actual results.

If you enjoy this post you may look at my [Annual Review for 2019](https://rasulkireev.com/2019-in-review/)

## Become a better Data Analyst - Great

This is a goal related to my professional career. I got my first full-time job as a data analyst, and I wanted to become much better at it. This is a vague goal, but I did not know what exactly getting better would mean for me. At the end of the year, I can say that I have become much better.

I am a much better Python programmer than I was at the start of the year. On top of that, I have learned a lot about processing large data sizes with parallel computing (spark, dask). I was more focused on data engineering, than analysis. I learned how to write Azure ARM templates, to deploy Data Lakes, VMs, and other resources. Given my experience learning Django, I was able to impress my management with a small web app, which has a lot of potential of becoming a real product at my firm. I am now planning to transition to a web dev role.

## Learning - Good

In my spare time, I have learned a lot of web technologies, such as [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), Javascript, and its children ([StimulusJS](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev), [Vue](https://vuejs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org)). I had a lot of other interests at the beginning of the year, like LaTeX, GraphQL, ArcGIS, and other fun things. Unfortunately, I only had the capacity and discipline to learn web dev.

On the web dev side, I have rebuilt my site with Gridsome, and am very happy with it. My site will be a [perfect sandbox](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/self-education) for my Vue (Javascript) learning. I have also built a small note-taking application for an interview at [Mailbrew](https://mailbrew.com/). Will continue on that front this year.

## Become the master of my mind and life - Bad

This was a complete miss, unfortunately.

At the start of the year I had a [mild depression](https://rasulkireev.com/dealing-with-mild-depression/).

At the end of the year, I have gained a lot of weight. My diet consisted of sweets and other junk food. This will be a big goal for 2021.

Regarding exercise and meditation, I'd say it is also a fail. Even though I did do some exercise and meditation it was not enough to make an impact. This will also transition into next year's goals.

## Earn some cash from a side hustle - Fail

$0. This year I'll make it happen!

## Become more sociable - Good

This year I was active on Twitter. I found a few cool people and even managed to talk founders of [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) ([Tristan Homsi](https://tristanh.github.io) and [Daniel Doyon](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion)) and [Mailbrew](https://mailbrew.com/) ([Francesco Di Lorenzo](https://francescodilorenzo.com) and [Fabrizio Rinaldi](https://fabriziorinaldi.com)) through Twitter. This was an insane experience.

## Become a more loving husband - Good-ish

This is hard to quantifн, but I can say that in general my wife and I had a good year. We had some ups and downs, but the general direction is good.

## Write more often - OK
I had a goal of writing 50 posts. The goal was too ambitious. However I did manage to write a couple of posts that resonated with people a bit. [How to Save Emails to Pocket](https://rasulkireev.com/emails-to-pocket/) and [Managing a Django Project with Poetry
](https://rasulkireev.com/managing-django-with-poetry/) are the first that come to mind.

Additionally, if you consider [a newsletter issue](https://rasulkireev.com/newsletter/) as a post then I might be very close to 50.

I wish to continue this trend further. I am much more comfortable with putting my thoughts out there.

##  Start a podcast - Meh

I have recorded interviews but did not publish them. Thus, it is a fail. Still a goal for 2021.

## Get out of debt - Good

Almost done. Will complete in 2021.

## Buy an existing company - Fail
Failed. Migrating to 2021.
