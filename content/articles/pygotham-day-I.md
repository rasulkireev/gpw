description: First Day of my first conference. I tried to make good notes during the talks I attended.
---

This is a first conference I have ever attended. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be 'great'. Here is why:

* I've met a lot of people with similar interest personality types, which is hard to do in regular setting.
* I've made a number of "useful" contacts that might help me find a good job.
* I've seen a lot of interesting presentations that have sparked my interest in programming (in Python) even more.

During the event I took notes with [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) , which is a great open-source note-taking app. I strongly recommended to everyone. **Not a sponsor**.

The general structure of the notes you are about to read is the same:

# Name of the talk
## Author
* Notes are going to be bullet points.
`If i have any notes above the bullet point above, I will leave them in this grey {code} block`
* I will try to leave find as links as possible, so you don't have to google everything.


So, without further ado, here are the notes I've taken during the first day of the event.

# Python use spectrum
## Kojo Idrissa
* More speakers always needed.
`This makes me want to make a talk to present at one of the conferences, seems totally doable and great for portfolio.`
* Volunteers always needed
`Certainly feel I should have been volunteering at this event. Will try to consider volunteering much more often`
* [Defna.org](http://Defna.org) - Django organization

# Eita! Why internalization and localization matter
## Nicolle Cysneiros [@Labcodes](https://labcodes.com.br/) - (Web Design Agency whos tech stack is python, django and js)
### Differences in formats across countries
* Date Formats (mm/dd/yyy vs. dd/mm/yyyy, etc)
* Number Formats (123,123 vs 123.123)
* Currency, [Bidirectional Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_Text)  & [Unicode Characters](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/unicode-characters.html) differ from country to country.
### Python library to deal with that
* GNU [`gettext`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)
  * This piece of software essentially is helping you to create a 'list' of text blocks that will need to be translated.
* [`locale`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/locale.html) module.
  * This module helps change the formats of the above mentioned differences.
* Apparently Django makes it super easy.

# Django + ElasticSearch without invalidation logic
## [Fl√°vio Juvenal](https://twitter.com/flaviojuvenal?lang=en) @[vinta](https://www.vinta.com.br/)
* Most popular search engine
* Why use search engine
  * Tokenization
  * Fuzzy similarity
  * Cleaning
* Elastic search built ins
* Less than million rows of Data can be searched with postgres built-in capabilities (check Django postgres search ) if more than 1m than implement elastic search
* [Haystack library](Haystack library) for search in Django
* [Zombodb](https://github.com/zombodb/zombodb) works with postgres (via access method API) (Django-zombodb)
  * will Soon work with postgres 11

# Static Typing in Python
## [Dustin Ingram](https://dustingram.com/) @Google @di_codes
* type errors happen
  * When Python expects a list received a string and converts that to a list , ugly list
* Python originally is dynamically typed, but can also be static. Which is a great strength
* Pep 3107 fucntions
  * Def Foo() <- max(2,9)
  * Foo.__annotations
* [Mypy](http://www.mypy-lang.org/) from PhD introduced on pycon us 2013
  * Experimental variant of Python that is statically typed
  * After talking to Guido decided to implement to pure Python
* pep 483 theory of type hints
  * Optional typing (+gradual typing)
  * Variable annotation
* Check data science from scratch again, it has some static type instructions
* Pep 484 type hints
* `Pip install mypy`
* When not to use : never
* When to use : as much as possible (Start early)
  * When code is confusing
  * When for public consumption
  * Before big migrations and refactoring
* Start early
* Note : not a replacement for unit test

## [Annie Cook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annielcook/) @[nylas](https://www.nylas.com/) - hiring
* [Mypy](http://www.mypy-lang.org/) is a static typechecker , type of documention (self documenting )

twitterLink: ""
hnLink: ""
redditLink: ""
  Return
```

* Captures a large category of errors
* Union is a multiple type
* _learn x in y minutes_ . Saw some guy in the talk use this website, seemed interesting
