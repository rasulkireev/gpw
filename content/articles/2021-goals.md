As per Todoist's [post](https://blog.doist.com/annual-review/) on completing Annual Review, here are five major parts of life that you should/could judge on:

- Work
- Productivity
- Health
- Finance
- Relationships
- Learning

So the following is the exercise of me going through my 2021 goals and categorizing them based on the groups above.

## Work
- get promoted at my current job (from Data Analyst to Web Development)
- Built a webapp at current job (in production)
- Build a Django course with [newline](https://www.newline.co)
- [Built with django](https://builtwithdjango.com)
  - Start a podcast (built with Django and personal)
  - build a job board
  - Publish a couple of written interviews

## Productivity
- spend some time each day writing. This could be:
  - sharing progress on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rasulkireev)
  - writing thoughts in a journal or for a [blog post](https://rasulkireev.com/articles/)
  - [tech tutorials](https://rasulkireev.com/tutorials/)
  - [book reviews](https://rasulkireev.com/book-notes/)
  - zettelkasten
- Use [Todoist](https://rasulkireev.com/book-notes/) to track tasks. Consult it often.
- use [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/about) regularly.

## Health
- lose fat, gain muscle. This means:
  - better diet
  - more exercise
- more meditation

## Finance
- earn cash (>$1) with a side hustle
- Get out of debt

## Relationships
- help my wife find her calling
- Become more social
  - get 100 [newsletter subscriber](https://buttondown.email/rasulkireev/) by the end of 2021
  - get 500 Twitter followers by the end of 2021
- Join a club or two, based on my interests (for example, Chess or Board Games communities)
- sponsor 5 people on Github
- would be awesome to get one [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors)

## Learning
- use [vim](https://www.vim.org) for all my coding
- get to 1600 level in [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/rasulkireev) and/or beat my dad
- [Buy an existing company/project](https://www.microacquisitions.com/)
- Become much better with Python
- build 5 small web projects with different tech
  - react
  - GeoDjango
  - serverless (AWS lambda)
  - d3.js
  - Shopify app with Django
- contribute to open source
  - Gridsome plugin
  - Pocket/Todoist OAuth2.0 API to Django-Allauth
  - plugin for [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org) to export to markdown
- progress in learning Italian, using Anki
- increase typing speed

## Conclusion

I have started a spreadsheet to track some of the goals here (that are possible to track). Hope to see a lot of progress on most of them. There are a lot of goals, but most of them I'd say doable. Now just need to prioritize and start grinding.

Will reflect next year, maybe mid-year also.
