Hey, Happy Tuesday!

I don't have much to share this week, so let's get straight to business.

## 📜 Quote of the week

> While it’s better to lurk rather than needlessly comment, it’s even better to add value into the community even if you don’t feel that you’re ready. If you struggle with this, as many do, remind yourself that if you have something to add, it’s selfish to keep it to yourself! (Location 482)

I found this to be true for myself and I'm pretty sure that a lot of people feel that way. When you join a new community or even if you have been a part of one for a while it can be scary to contribute and speak your mind. You feel you are not good enough or not experienced enough. Even if that is the case, that is how you learn, by contributing and communicating with other members of that community. I will argue that this is not the case. If you think that you are not good enough, it means that you are humble. This is an amazing quality when it comes to learning from other people. So, go out there and contribute! People need your thoughts, it's selfish not to share 😄

## Feedback

🖊️ This is for everyone who is still subscribed and opens these emails. You might have received a letter from me last week, asking for some feedback. If you did you can ignore this 😄

❓ To anyone who read this, I want to ask:
- How long have you been reading this newsletter?
- Do you enjoy reading it?
- What would you change or see more of?
- What would you remove, if anything?

🗣️ Your thoughts, comments, and general feedback are very important to me. Since, I don't many subscribers, each comment, suggestion makes a big difference.

🙏 Thanks a ton in advance.

## The Classical Education

📈 This is a small update on my journey of pursuing [Classical Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World).

🔟 I'm following a [10-year plan](https://thinkingwest.com/10-year-reading-plan/) that has been created by the editors of the set. The goal of the plan is to introduce you to all the authors in the set in a friendly manner. According to editors, the 10 year plan is sorted based on difficulty, with the first year being the simplest.

🤝 The best way to learn from those books (besides reading them) is to discuss them with friends. So, I'm trying to find people who will be interested in joining me on this journey. If you are interested, let me know.

📓 I have [a Notion list in progress](https://rasulkireev.notion.site/a505de6610a8421c97d679c2ddf0d845?v=62dd50401f864ad1b11d0e2ed82475d0) where I put all the "required" reading into a nice table with links to free readings. Yes, all of the readings are available for free on the internet, so no need for financial investment, just your time.

## 🐦 Tweet of the Week

I usually don't like threads like these, they seem very low effort. However, there are a couple of interesting recommendations.
