Hey, Happy Tuesday!

This week I don't have anything concrete prepared to talk about, so I'm just going to share with you a couple of small things. Hope you find them interesting.

## 📜 Quote of the week

> I had spent a weekend building the prototype of Gumroad, a tool that helped creators sell their products online. No complicated setup. No elaborate storefront. Just a link for customers to pay and you’re in business. (Location 48)
>
> [The Minimalist Entrepreneur](https://amzn.to/3Jdkqzz) by [Sahil Lavingia](https://sahillavingia.com/)

Another quote from the Minimalist Entrepreneur. What can I say it is a great book. Full review on my website is coming soon 😄.

This idea is very similar to [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/)'s (the OG Indiehacker) business [CDBaby](https://cdbaby.com/) (first service that helped musicians sell their music) but for everything.

Idea is so simple, but it is so important and effective. **Help people make money and the'll pay you for it.**

I have stumbled on Alexey's site through HackerNews, where he shared his [Theses On Sleep](https://guzey.com/theses-on-sleep/). I did not end up reading it fully, just glanced over, but I did end uup reading a lot of other content on Alexey's site. It reminded me a lot of [Gwern's personal website](https://www.gwern.net/). This level of depth and quality is something I strive for with my own site, although I'm no way near, needless to say.

This is probably not too relevant for you, but I fell in love with this picture. As you might have guessed, books are one of my passions. It is one of my big goals to have enough space and income to make something like this for myself. Probably sounds silly, but, oh well, what you're going to do? 😆
