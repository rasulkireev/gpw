Hey {{ subscriber.metadata.first_name }}, Happy Tuesday!

{% else %}

Hey, Happy Tuesday!

{% endif %}

First let me apologize for not sending for a while. I don't really have an explanation, but now I was able to more or less transition my systems into a state where this newsletter is enjoyable to do.

I looked at my precious issues and realized that they were quite long, so I'll try to keep them shorter from now on, unless I have something really interesting to say.

If you don't want to receive these, feel free to unsubscribe, the link is in the bottom of this email.

With all of that in mind let's get going üöÄ. Hope you enjoy this week's issue.

## üòÑ Quick Personal Updates

1. This week I published two book summaries:
   - [Fluent Forever by Gabriel Wyner](https://rasulkireev.com/fluent-forever-book-review/)
   - [Doing Content Right by Steph Smith](https://rasulkireev.com/doing-content-right-book-review/)

2. I'm starting to feel a little burn out from work and side projects as I've been hitting road blocks for some time now. Switching to producing content like this newsletter makes me feel a little better üòÑ

## üìú Quote of the week

> "The masculine grows by challenge, but the feminine grows by praise. A man must be unabashed and expressed in his appreciation for his woman. Praise her freely. (Location¬†817)"
>
> [The Way of the Superior Man](https://amzn.to/3E7WKtH) by [David Deida](https://deida.info/)

This quote came up in my Readwise dashboard this week and made me think. I feel like the fire in my eyes has gone down a bit (as mentioned earlier) and as a consequence I hae been much less attentive to my significant other. Probably been more critiquing, even. So, this has been a great reminder that women do grow in more positive and praising environemnt. Will be trying to say more good things to my SO and suggest you do the same üòÑ

## üß† Random Thought

In the pursuit of automating everything, we lose the touch with the process. When it comes to learning, less automation is better. Move away from automation.
