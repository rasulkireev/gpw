Hey, Happy 2022!

This year I hope to renew the habit of sending a weekly newsletter to you filled with quick updates about my learning and progress on various projects, but most importantly interesting things I have ran into during the week that you will find interesting or entertainging.

If you don't want to receive these, feel free to unsubscribe, the link is in the bottom of this email.

With all of that in mind let's get going üöÄ. Hope you enjoy this week's issue.

## üìú Quote of the week

> "The masculine grows by challenge, but the feminine grows by praise. A man must be unabashed and expressed in his appreciation for his woman. Praise her freely. (Location¬†817)"
>
> [The Way of the Superior Man](https://amzn.to/3E7WKtH) by [David Deida](https://deida.info/)

This quote came up in my Readwise dashboard this week and made me think. I feel like the fire in my eyes has gone down a bit (as mentioned earlier) and as a consequence I have been much less attentive to my significant other. Probably been more critiquing, even. So, this has been a great reminder that women do grow in more positive and praising environemnt. Will be trying to say more good things to my SO and suggest you do the same üòÑ

## üß† Random Thought

In the pursuit of automating everything, we lose the touch with the process. When it comes to learning, less automation is better. Move away from automation.

## *üêî Tweets of the week*

Totally agree with Juvoni on this one. I used to focus too much on goals, but noticed that when I focus on the simplification of the process, the habit was much easier to to stick and therefore lead to the completion of the goal. So, by focusing on the system, not only one can complete his goals simpler, but will also enjoy a more structure life with more time for other activities.

Going in to 2022 try to remember that there is just an infinite amount of things you can reach. Let's do that together. If you have any goals set for 2022, let me know, maybe I can help in some way. Or perhaps, we have similar goals and can push each other to complete them.
