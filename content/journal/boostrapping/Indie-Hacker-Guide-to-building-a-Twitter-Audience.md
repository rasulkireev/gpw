The Indie Hacker Guide to building a Twitter Audience

https://www.indiehackers.com/post/the-indie-hacker-guide-to-building-a-twitter-audience-89d227e300

# Step 1: Choose the topics you want to tweet about

everyone should pick about 3 - 5 topics where they consistently tweet about.

That doesn’t mean you can’t tweet about anything else. It just means these are your main topics.

IF the tweet does well, add a tweet to at (create a thread) and link to your website.

Tweets with links in them get fewer impressions.

# Step 2: Get your basics in order

Write a compelling bio. Why should people follow you?

Scroll down your timeline and remove all the B/S you’ve been tweeting about. 

# Step 3: Follow the right people

You want to follow accounts that have a lot of RT’s, and comments. Because the more engagement the more impressions. The more impressions the more your time spent on commenting on their tweets is rewarded.

# Step 4: Tweet smart, not often

If you can tickle the algorithm to like you, your tweets will be shown to more people.

The basic rule is: always talk about them. I don’t have statistics on this but if YOU mention the word YOU in your tweet, chances are a lot bigger you’ll get more engagement while saying almost the same. They read you and think (he's talking about) me.

Tip: Have 10 quotes ready from the account you’re following. Once they tweet you immediately comment on his tweet with a quote (that’s easy with His Holiness) and you RT your tweet. (Don't do this yourself unless you are in the self-help niche)

Don’t be blown away but you should be commenting about 10x - 15x a day on other people's timelines vs only tweeting 2 - 3x a day on your own to start with.

# Step 5: What to tweet about

Talk about your users. Show people interesting angles not directly related to your project. Don’t show screenshots from your product. Show something a user did or create a (small) case study.

Share your ups and downs but always inspire. That means you can have a shitty day or a tweet that talks shit but people are more likely to engage if something is inspiring about it.
